    I've been getting many notification bookings popping up "Come play at my Jazz event", It’s funny too because realistically I don’t actively promote my Jazz band. With Moving Music I get 4-5 invites per day, I can't imagine my life without Moving Music.

    I'm a new Dj getting into the scene. I didn't know how to get my name out there but with Moving Music I now get bookings from bars all over the GTA.

    I'm a Korean pop singer trying to break out into the Toronto music scene. Before Moving Music I would get maybe 1-2 events per month, since I started using Moving Music I get 3-5 Korean Pop events per month. I also love that their is no membership. Moving Music was very as to navigate.
